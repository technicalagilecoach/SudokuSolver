# Notes
- run propagation between different solver strategies? 
- Grid.Init assumes that the input puzzles always follows the expected syntax -> no error handling otherwise
- handling connected twins for regions is missing
- brute force search is not implemented but could help if all else fails
- make a nicer equality check for BitArrays than AreEqual
